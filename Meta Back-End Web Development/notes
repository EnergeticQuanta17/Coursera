	React creates a virtual DOM
		It keeps record of what needs to be updated.

		If the node is same --> then don't change --> this process is called reconsiliation

		REACT UPDATES VIRTUAL D0M

		React builds a representation of the browser Document Object Model or DOM in memory called the virtual DOM. As components are updated, React checks to see if the component’s HTML code in the virtual DOM matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser DOM is updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed.

		Step 1: The virtual DOM is updated.

		Step 2: The virtual DOM is compared to the previous version of the virtual DOM and checks which elements have changed.

		Step 3: The changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.

		Step 4: The displayed webpage updates to match the browser DOM.


	REACT FIBER ARCHITECTURE
		incrementally render the web page --> spread the update over time

	COMPONENT HIERARCHY

	React is a library

	Commonly used supporting libraries are:-
		Lodash
		Luxon
		Redux
		Axios
		Jest

METADATA CHEAT SHEEET --> https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-and-css-in-depth/supplement/8QDS1/metadata-cheat-sheet

Metadata cheat sheet
HTML <meta> tags 
Earlier in the course, you learned about meta tags and how you can leverage them to convey information to search engines to better categorize your pages. We recommend that you keep this cheat sheet handy when building your web applications. The structure of a meta tag is as follows.

Name 
The name of the property can be anything you like, although browsers usually expect a value they understand and can take an action upon. An example would be <meta name="author" content="name"> to state the author of the page. 

Content 

The content field specifies the property's value. For example, you can use <meta name="language" content="english">, to specify the language of the webpage to search engines. 

Charset 

The charset is a special field that lets you specify the character encoding used for the page so that the browser can display it properly. The most frequently used is utf-8, and you would add it to your HTML header as follows: <meta charset="UTF-8">  

HTTP-equiv 

This field stands for HTTP equivalent, and it’s used to simulate HTTP response headers. This is rare to see, and it’s recommended to use HTTP headers over HTML http-equiv meta tags. For example, the next tag would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 30 minutes: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> 


Basic meta tags (meta tags For SEO) 
<meta name="description"/> provides a brief description of the web page 

<meta name=”title”/> specifies the title of the web page 

<meta name="author" content="name"> specifies the author of the web page  

<meta name="language" content="english"> specifies the language of the web page 



<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" /> tells search engines how to crawl or index a certain page 

<meta name="google"/> tells Google not to show the sitelinks search box for your page when showing search results 

<meta name="googlebot" content=”notranslate” /> tells Google you don’t want to provide an automatic translation for your page if the user uses a different language  

<meta name="revised" content="Sunday, July 18th, 2010, 5:15 pm" /> specifies the last modified date and time on which you have made certain changes 

<meta name="rating" content="safe for kids"> specifies the expected audience for your page 

<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2022"> specifies a Copyright 


<meta http-equiv="..."/> tags
 <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html"> specifies the format of the document returned by the server 

<meta http-equiv="default-style"/>  specifies the format of the styling document 

<meta http-equiv="refresh"/> specifies the duration of the page before it’s considered stale 

<meta http-equiv=”Content-language”/> specifies the language of the page 

<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache"> instructs the browser how to cache your page 

Responsive design/mobile meta tags 
<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=yes"/> indicates that telephone numbers should appear as hypertext links that can be clicked to make a phone call 

<meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true"/> specifies that the page can be properly visualized on mobile devices 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/> specifies the area of the window in which web content can be seen

INPUT TYPES
	
Required
Denotes a mandatory input that the user can’t leave empty. It can be used with any input type, like password, radio, text and so on. 

<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" required> 

Maxlength 
Specifies the maximum length of a text input, in other words, the maximum number of characters that can be entered for a specific field. If provided, it will prevent the user from entering more characters than the limit. 

<input type="text" id="description" name="description" maxlength="50"> 

Minlength 
Specifies the minimum length of a text input. If set, the input will not accept fewer characters than those specified. 

<input type="password" id="password" name="password" minlength="8"> 

Min and max attributes 
Determine the minimum and maximum values allowed for an input field. They are usually applied to numerical text inputs, range inputs or dates. 

<input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10"> 

<input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="1" max="100"> 

Multiple 
Indicates that the user can enter more than one value in a single input field. This attribute can only be used for email and file input types. 

<input type="file" id="gallery" name="gallery" multiple> 

Pattern 
Defines a particular pattern that an input field value has to fulfill to be considered valid. This attribute expects a regular expression to specify the pattern. It works with text, date, search, URL, tel, email and password input types. For example, you can restrict phone numbers to be only from the UK. 
<input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern=”^(?:0|\+?44)(?:\d\s?){9,10}$” >
