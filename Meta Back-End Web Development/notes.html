	React creates a virtual DOM
		It keeps record of what needs to be updated.

		If the node is same --> then don't change --> this process is called reconsiliation

		REACT UPDATES VIRTUAL D0M

		React builds a representation of the browser Document Object Model or DOM in memory called the virtual DOM. As components are updated, React checks to see if the component’s HTML code in the virtual DOM matches the browser DOM. If a change is required, the browser DOM is updated. If nothing has changed, then no update is performed.

		Step 1: The virtual DOM is updated.

		Step 2: The virtual DOM is compared to the previous version of the virtual DOM and checks which elements have changed.

		Step 3: The changed elements are updated in the browser DOM.

		Step 4: The displayed webpage updates to match the browser DOM.


	REACT FIBER ARCHITECTURE
		incrementally render the web page --> spread the update over time

	COMPONENT HIERARCHY

	React is a library

	Commonly used supporting libraries are:-
		Lodash
		Luxon
		Redux
		Axios
		Jest

METADATA CHEAT SHEEET --> https://www.coursera.org/learn/html-and-css-in-depth/supplement/8QDS1/metadata-cheat-sheet

Metadata cheat sheet
HTML <meta> tags 
Earlier in the course, you learned about meta tags and how you can leverage them to convey information to search engines to better categorize your pages. We recommend that you keep this cheat sheet handy when building your web applications. The structure of a meta tag is as follows.

Name 
The name of the property can be anything you like, although browsers usually expect a value they understand and can take an action upon. An example would be <meta name="author" content="name"> to state the author of the page. 

Content 

The content field specifies the property's value. For example, you can use <meta name="language" content="english">, to specify the language of the webpage to search engines. 

Charset 

The charset is a special field that lets you specify the character encoding used for the page so that the browser can display it properly. The most frequently used is utf-8, and you would add it to your HTML header as follows: <meta charset="UTF-8">  

HTTP-equiv 

This field stands for HTTP equivalent, and it’s used to simulate HTTP response headers. This is rare to see, and it’s recommended to use HTTP headers over HTML http-equiv meta tags. For example, the next tag would instruct the browser to refresh the page every 30 minutes: <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="30"> 


Basic meta tags (meta tags For SEO) 
<meta name="description"/> provides a brief description of the web page 

<meta name=”title”/> specifies the title of the web page 

<meta name="author" content="name"> specifies the author of the web page  

<meta name="language" content="english"> specifies the language of the web page 



<meta name="robots" content="index,follow" /> tells search engines how to crawl or index a certain page 

<meta name="google"/> tells Google not to show the sitelinks search box for your page when showing search results 

<meta name="googlebot" content=”notranslate” /> tells Google you don’t want to provide an automatic translation for your page if the user uses a different language  

<meta name="revised" content="Sunday, July 18th, 2010, 5:15 pm" /> specifies the last modified date and time on which you have made certain changes 

<meta name="rating" content="safe for kids"> specifies the expected audience for your page 

<meta name="copyright" content="Copyright 2022"> specifies a Copyright 


<meta http-equiv="..."/> tags
 <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html"> specifies the format of the document returned by the server 

<meta http-equiv="default-style"/>  specifies the format of the styling document 

<meta http-equiv="refresh"/> specifies the duration of the page before it’s considered stale 

<meta http-equiv=”Content-language”/> specifies the language of the page 

<meta http-equiv="Cache-Control" content="no-cache"> instructs the browser how to cache your page 

Responsive design/mobile meta tags 
<meta name="format-detection" content="telephone=yes"/> indicates that telephone numbers should appear as hypertext links that can be clicked to make a phone call 

<meta name="HandheldFriendly" content="true"/> specifies that the page can be properly visualized on mobile devices 

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/> specifies the area of the window in which web content can be seen

INPUT TYPES
	
Required
Denotes a mandatory input that the user can’t leave empty. It can be used with any input type, like password, radio, text and so on. 

<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName" required> 

Maxlength 
Specifies the maximum length of a text input, in other words, the maximum number of characters that can be entered for a specific field. If provided, it will prevent the user from entering more characters than the limit. 

<input type="text" id="description" name="description" maxlength="50"> 

Minlength 
Specifies the minimum length of a text input. If set, the input will not accept fewer characters than those specified. 

<input type="password" id="password" name="password" minlength="8"> 

Min and max attributes 
Determine the minimum and maximum values allowed for an input field. They are usually applied to numerical text inputs, range inputs or dates. 

<input type="number" id="quantity" name="quantity" min="1" max="10"> 

<input type="range" id="volume" name="volume" min="1" max="100"> 

Multiple 
Indicates that the user can enter more than one value in a single input field. This attribute can only be used for email and file input types. 

<input type="file" id="gallery" name="gallery" multiple> 

Pattern 
Defines a particular pattern that an input field value has to fulfill to be considered valid. This attribute expects a regular expression to specify the pattern. It works with text, date, search, URL, tel, email and password input types. For example, you can restrict phone numbers to be only from the UK. 
<input type="tel" id="phone" name="phone" pattern=”^(?:0|\+?44)(?:\d\s?){9,10}$” > 



datalist "input type"


by default it is set to "get" method

<form method="get">
</form>

<form method="post">
</form>

<form action="/login"> 
</form> 

<label>
Defines a label for an element. It has an attribute "for", the value of which should be equal to the id attribute of the element it is associated with. Note how in the example above, the <label> is associated with the <input> using its id value. 

<select>
Defines a drop-down list of options presented to the user. It has a couple of attributes: 
Form, the id of the form in which the drop-down appears 
Name specifies the name of the control 
Multiple Boolean attribute, when specified, indicates if a user can select multiple options out of the list 
Required indicates if the user is required to select an option before submitting a form 
Size mentions the number of visible options in a drop-down list 
The options in a drop-down list are defined using the <option> element inside <select>. 

<textarea>
Defines a multi-line input field, typically to allow the user to input longer textual data. The common attributes for this element include: 
cols defines the width of the text area, the default value is 20 
form the form element the text area is associated with 
maxlength when specified, limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered in the text area 
minlength the minimum number of characters that the user should enter 
readonly once set, the user cannot modify the contents 
rows defines the number of visible text lines for the text area 

<button>
Defines a clickable button. The onclick attribute defines the behavior when the button is clicked by the user.

<fieldset> 
Used to group related input elements in a form. For instance, elements related to the user’s personal information and educational qualification can be grouped separately in two field sets. 

<legend> 
Defines a caption for the <fieldset> element.

<datalist>
Specifies a list of pre-defined options for an input element. It differs from <select> since the user can still provide textual or numeric input other than the listed options. 

<datalist>
Specifies a list of pre-defined options for an input element. It differs from <select> since the user can still provide textual or numeric input other than the listed options. 

<output> 
Represents the result of a calculation (typically the output of a script) or the outcome of the user action. 

<option> 
Defines an option for the drop-down list. The following code example demonstrates how a simple list can be defined, with the rendered view below the code block. 
To define a pre-selected option, add the selected attribute to the option. 

<optgroup>

One last thing to note is that like videos and audio, the web browser only supports specific file types. These file types are: 
	.APNG – Animated Portable Network Graphics 
	.AVIF – AV1 Image Format 
	.GIF – Graphics Interchange Format 
	.JPEG / .JPG – Joint Photographic Expert Group image format 
	.PNG – Portable Network Graphics 
	.SVG – Scalable Vector Graphics 
	.WEBP – Web Picture Format 

The <iframe> is the inline frame element that embeds an HTML page into another page. 

allow="fullscreen” the fullscreen mode can be activated 

allow=“geolocation” lets you access the user’s location 

<iframe src="https://example.com/…" allow="camera; microphone"> </iframe> 

<iframe name = "My Frame" width="400" height="300"></iframe>  

sandbox 
To enforce greater security, a sandbox applies extra restrictions to the content in the <iframe>. To lift particular restrictions, an attribute value (permission token) is used. The common permission tokens are listed below: 
	allow-downloads Allows the user to download an item 
	allow-forms Allows the user to submit forms 
	allow-modals The resource can open modal windows 
	allow-orientation-lock Lets the resource lock the screen orientation 
	allow-popups Allows popups to open 
	allow-presentation Allows a presentation session to start 
	allow-scripts Lets the resource run scripts without creating popup windows 

srcdoc
	Let's you specify the inline HTML to embed in the <iframe>. When defined, this attribute would override the src attribute.

loading
	This attribute let's you specify if the iframe should be loaded immediately when the web page loads (eager) or loaded when iframe is displayed in the browser (lazy). This allows you to defer loading iframe content if it is further down your web page and outside of the display area when the page is initially loaded.

	<iframe src="my_iframe_src.html" loading="lazy" > 
	</iframe> 

<iframe src="history.html" title="An embedded document about the history of my family" > 
</iframe>

	justify-content. For item alignment on main axis.

	align-items. For item alignment on cross axis.

	align-self. For unique flex items on cross axis.

	align-content. Used for packing flex lines and control over space.

.flex-container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    flex-direction: column;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    align-items:flex-end;
    gap:10px;

    align-self: center;
}

.box3{
    background-color: blanchedalmond;
    align-self: center;
    flex: 1 1 auto;
}

	Child selectors (using >)
	General sibling selectors (using ~)
	Adjacent sibling selectors (using +)

Pseudo-classes
	Hover
	In focus
	Visted links
	Specific elements

	selector:pseudo-class {
		property: value
	}	

	:hover
	:active
	:focus

	Form states
		:disabled and :enabled
		:checked and :indeterminate
		:valid and :invalid

CSS keyframes
		@keyframes animation-name { 

			from { 

			property-a: value-a; 

			} 

			 

			to { 

			property-a: value-b; 

			} 

			}

@keyframes identifier { 

0% {transform: rotate(100deg);} 

30% {opacity: 1;} 

50% {opacity: 0.50;} 

70% {opacity: 1;} 

100% {transform: rotate(50deg);} 

The output is drastically different now after adding just two lines of code. Just like this, you can keep adding steps inside your @keyframes rule to make it even more dynamic and add the desired animation effects. Animation property and @keyframes rule can be used in very creative ways to enhance a web page.
