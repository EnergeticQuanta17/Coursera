DATASETS
	National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

	The Cartwheel Dataset

	Seaborn Tips Dataset


Learning from data
Data analysis methods and their properties
Research methodology

Properties of statistical methods

Reduction and Summarization

Data can be misleading
Margin of error -->

"Science of decisions"
Great emphasis on variation of data

Art of forecasting

Science of measurement

Basis for principled data collection
	provides a rational way to manage the trade-off of --> collect least data possible {resource limitations} 

Where does the data come from?
	Organic/Process data --> stock --> Big Data
	Designed data collection

	i.i.d ==> independent and identically distributed

	Can we apply statistical procedures that assume i.i.d data?

Confirmatory versus Exploratory Research --> watch out for-->
	overfitting
	multiple testing
	p-hacking

The more questions you ask from a dataset the more likely you are to draw a misleading conclusion

Observational data vs Experiments

Power Analysis and Bias

Typical Rectangular Data Set
Spreadsheet Software
Databases and Other Tools
Data Files for Storage and Exchange
Repeated Measures Data: Wide and Long
Wide Form Data
Long Form Data
Uses of wide and long format data layouts
More Specialized Data Formats

Categorial Data
	Bar Chart
	Pie Chart

Histograms
	Shape    --> Symmetric, bell-shaped, left-skewed, right-skewed
	Center   --> Mean or Median
	Spread   --> Range, Interquartile Range (IQR), Standard deviation, Variance
	Outliers --> Data points that fall far from the bulk of the data

	Unimodal --> one peak {in shape analysis}

Bar Charts --> Categorial data
Histograms --> Quantitative data

Doubt :-> MEAN of a histogram, how to calculate it visually

BELL GRAPH	
	If we go 1 S.D. on both sides --> 68% 
	If we go 1 S.D. on both sides --> 95%
	If we go 1 S.D. on both sides --> 99.7%

	"Empirical rule" --> "68 - 95 - 99.7 rule"

	Z-Score --> (observation - mean)/SD

BOXPLOTS
	Length of boxplot is the InterQuartileRange (IQR)
	Median is marked along the width
	Dotted lines till max and min
