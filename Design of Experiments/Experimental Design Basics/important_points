basic course in designing experiments and analyzing the resulting data

The course objective is to learn how to plan, design and conduct experiments efficiently and effectively, and analyze the resulting data to obtain objective conclusions

Randomization
Replication
Blocking - a technique to control nuisance variation during the experiment

2 sample t test
	compare two level of a factor

Fisher's Blocking Concept
	Background noise

"If you have 10 weeks to solve a problem, you should spend eight weeks planning the experiment, one week running it and one week analyzing the data." - Douglas Montgomery

Randomization
	Doing this induces the notion of balancing out effects of the "lurking" variables

Replication
	Sample size (improving precision of effect estimation, estimation of error or background noise)
	Replication vs repeat experiments

Strategies of Experimentation
	1. Best-guess experiments
		backed by experience and knowledge in that area

	2. One-Factor-At-a-Time (OFTA) experiments
		Very inefficient

	3. Statistically Designed Experiments
		Based on Fisher's factorial concept

Planning, Conducting and Analyzing an Experiment
	Pre-Experimental Planning
		1. Recognition of & statement of problem
		2. Choice of factors, levels and ranges
		3. Selection of the response variable(s)

	4. Choice of design
	5. Conducting the experiment
	6. Statistical Analysis
	7. Drawing conclusions, recommendations

Montgomery's first theorem of running experiments
	If you want it done right, do it yourself.

If you've blown the experiment before step 6, statistics is not going to help you.
