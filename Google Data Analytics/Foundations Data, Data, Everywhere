Data Scientists vs Data Analysts
	Data Science --> Creating new ways of modeling and understanding the unknown by using raw data

Data Analysis --> collection, transformation, organization --:> conclusions, predictions, decision-making

Data Analytics --> Science of data

Analysts use data-driven decision-making and follow a step-by-step process. You have learned that there are six steps to this process:
	Ask questions and define the problem.
	Prepare data by collecting and storing the information.
	Process data by cleaning and checking the information.
	Analyze data to find patterns, relationships, and trends.
	Share data with your audience.
	Act on the data and use the analysis results.

The data analysis life cycleâ€”the process of going from data to decision

The process presented as part of the Google Data Analytics Certificate is one that will be valuable to you as you keep moving forward in your career:
	Ask: Business Challenge/Objective/Question
	Prepare: Data generation, collection, storage, and data management
	Process: Data cleaning/data integrity
	Analyze: Data exploration, visualization, and analysis
	Share: Communicating and interpreting results 
	Act:  Putting your insights to work to solve the problem

SAS's iterative life cycle
	An iterative life cycle was created by a company called SAS, a leading data analytics solutions provider. It can be used to produce repeatable, reliable, and predictive results: 
		Ask
		Prepare
		Explore
		Model
		Implement
		Act
		Evaluate

Project-based data analytics life cycle 
A project-based data analytics life cycle has five simple steps:
	Identifying the problem
	Designing data requirements
	Pre-processing data
	Performing data analysis
	Visualizing data

Big data analytics life cycle
Authors Thomas Erl, Wajid Khattak, and Paul Buhler proposed a big data analytics life cycle in their book, Big Data Fundamentals: Concepts, Drivers & Techniques. Their life cycle suggests phases divided into nine steps:
	Business case evaluation
	Data identification
	Data acquisition and filtering
	Data extraction
	Data validation and cleaning 
	Data aggregation and representation
	Data analysis
	Data visualization
	Utilization of analysis results
