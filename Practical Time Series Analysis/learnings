Random Walks 
	Moving Average Processes  Introduction to Simulation  

Looking at the boxplot, it seems natural to ask whether the average coagulation times are independent of diet. This is a problem typically approached with ANOVA (Analysis of Variance).

R-Functions
	c()

	summary()

	mean()

	std()

	sum()

	median()

	hist()
		hist(data, xlab="", main="Histogram Title", freq=F, col='green')

		lines(density(data), col='red', lwd=5)

		hist(data, xlab="", main="Histogram Title", freq=F, col='green', breaks=10)
			"breaks" is Bin width

	rnorm(50, 78, 10)

	round()
		round(rnorm(50, 78, 10))

	ScatterPlot
		plot(round(rnorm(50, 78, 10)), round(rnorm(50, 78, 14)))

	co2
		Dataset - Time Series

	class(co2)
		Gave me --> "ts"
		For time series

	plot(co2, main='Atmospheric CO2 Concentration')

	co2.values = as.numeric(co2)
	co2.times = as.numeric( time(co2) )
	SSxx = sum( (co2.times - mean(co2.times) ) * (co2.times - mean(co2.times) ) )
	SSxy = sum( (co2.values - mean(co2.values) ) * (co2.times - mean(co2.times) ) )
	( slope = SSxy / SSxx )
	( intercept = mean(co2.values) - slope*mean(co2.times) )

	plot(co2, main='Atmospheric CO2 Concentration with Fitted Line')
	abline(co2.linear.model )

	co2.fitted.values = slope*co2.times + intercept
	co2.residuals = co2.values - co2.fitted.values

	( co2.residuals = resid( co2.linear.model ) )

Assumptions of Simple Regression Model
	(a)the errors are normally distributed and, on average, zero;

	(b) the errors all have the same variance (they are homoscedastic), and

	(c) the errors are unrelated to each other (they are independent across observations).

"astsa" package in R

AutoCovariance Function
Doubts
	Estimation of c_k
		In this we are not dividing by N

	what are lags in acf function

	Correlogram

Random Walks
	ACF of purely random --> has very very low correlation between the datapoints
		Obvious, isn't it?

	For MA(q) process
		thE ACF will cut from lag2
		Meaning it will have high correlation for only 2 lags after 0th lag which is 1 by default

	Trend makes the time series non-stationary.

Topics
	Stationarity
	Backward Shift Operator

Doubt
	How to show strict stationarity?

No t dependence --> (weakly) stationary

homoscedasticity

Invertibility condition for MA(q) processes
Stationarity condition for AR(p) processses
Duality between AR and MA processses

Mean Square Convergence
