Sequence data --> temporal sequence --> RNNs are used
NLP is advanced RNN + something (ig)

"Performance" vs "Amount of Data"
	In Traditional learning algorithms --> SVM, logistic regression --> Performance PLATEAUS out as the amount of data increases

	But DL --> have highest performance increase

Scale drives deep learning progress
	Data
	Computation
	Algorithm

Idea --> Code --> Experiment --> Repeat
