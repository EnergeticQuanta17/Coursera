	Augmentations
	Rotating
	Skewing
	Flipping
	Moving it around the frame

	Augmentations happen in memory

	TensorFlow Image Generation library

Transfer learning
	Avoid overfitting

	Inception Network

	Bootstrap the learning process

	That bigger model might have been able to spot features that you may not have been have able to splot in your dataset
		Take advantage of that

Multiclass Learning
	1000 classes

	Techniques are there to handle it

<--------------------------------Week-1-------------------------------->

Filtering the bad images out
	Tools for data cleaning

Convolution helps us find features which are independent of translational shifts

import ImageDataGenerator
	Initialize
	Has rescale parameter if not already rescaled


	train_generator = train_data.flow_from_directory(
		...
	)

		The above function does the following things
			Takes the directory
			Target size of image
			Batch size
			Class mode


model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
	tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3,3), activation='relu', input_shape=(150,150,3)),

	tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D(2,2),

	...
])

model.fit_generator(
	train_generator,
	steps_per_epoch=100,
	epochs=15,
	validation_data=validation_generator,
	validation_steps=50,
	verbose=2
)

Impact of cropping on training

To get the layers for visualization
	layer_names = [layer.name for layer in model.layers]

	You can see what is being emphasized

Learning History of the Model
	history.history['accuracy']
	history.history['loss']
	history.history['...']

	To get history object
		You get from
			model.fit(
				...
			)

	"Didn't really earn anything after 2 epochs "
		Conclusion from the plot of Validation Accuracy
