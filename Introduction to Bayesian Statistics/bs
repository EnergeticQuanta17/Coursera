The purpose of the set of courses is to focus on Inferential Statistics as opposed to Descriptive Statistics.

----Descriptive Statistics----
This is used to summarize the data so that we have a quantitative way to understand data. This allows to understand and visualize data qualitatively. We can draw conclusions about the nature of the data

-----Inferential Statistics-----
Inferential Statistics allow us to make generalizations about the population from the samples. This process of sampling introduces errors as this is never a perfect representation of the underlying data. The statistics thus computed are supposed to be an estimate of the true population parameters.

Inference
In Inference, you are trying to model a distribution and understand the process that generates the data. 

As opposed to Prediction --> is just like in Machine Learning
