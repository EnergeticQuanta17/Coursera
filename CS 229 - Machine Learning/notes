Support Vector Machines
	Infinite dimension vector to represent X

Cocktail Part Problem
	ICA	- Independent Component Analysis

Using Squared Error corresponds to Gaussian
	When seen from perspective of Generalized Linear Models

In Linear Regression,
	there will not be local optimum

	direct global minimum

del_wrt_A f(A) = 

We can derive the sigmoid from more basic principles
