Factors that affect "COLOR"
	Light sources
	Object surface properties
	Emittance
	Reflectance spectrum
	Position and Orientation

Most of the computer vision systems assume --> a local illumination model with no inter reflections, no scattering 

A correct illumination model needs to consider the inter reflections as well.

Spectral Power Distribution

Power Spectrum

Radiometric measurements are made at the light source --> represented as "radiance" or "luminance"

Radiometric measurements are made at the object surface --> irradiance or illuminance.

Reflection
	Specular reflection --> which obeys the law of reflection

	Diffuse reflection --> scattering

Bidirectional Reflection Distribution Function
	is a function of theta_i, phi_i, theta_e, phi_e

Conventional unit vectors
	L --> Towards Light source direction

	N --> Normal of surface

	R --> Angle of incidence

	V --> View direction

Lambertian Surface --> irregular surface --> lots of diffusion

	Angle of incidence matters

	Diffusion is maximum when incidence and normal are parallel

Albedo --> is the proportion of the incident light or radiation that is reflected by a surface

Earth's Albedo --> 0.3

Albedo varies with variation in the wavelength

Specular surfaces --> where intensity is maximum "near" the reflected ray

Pinhole Camera Model
	Follow the laws of Projective Geometry

	Perspective Projection --> geometric mapping from 3D to 2D

	Perspective Projection --> makes appear parallel lines are converging
		Point of convergence --> "Vanishing point"

		Planar structure of the scene and  relative depth


Weak Perspective --> orthographic camera models

Projective geometry
We must use "homogeneous coordinate system"


Pinhole Camera Model

	On the other side, at the distance of focal length from the pinhole --> Virtual Image Plane

	World --> Camera --> Image Plane --> Pixel

	(X,Y,Z) --> (Xc,Yc,Zc) --> (x,y) --> (u,v)

	Backward Projection --, i.e. reverse direction of the previous equation is challenging

	Computer vision deals with this problem

Rods --> light intensity
Cones --> Color senstitive

COLOR THEORY
	Trichromatic Theory
		Any visible can be replicated using just three primary colors

Color Filter Arrays
	Three are used for each channel i.e. red, green, blue

	And then Demosaic-ed to form 3 channel image

	Demosaic-ed using interpolation techniques

We need negative intensity of RED to represent all the visible

Hence we need better primary color selection

To overcome the hurdle of the negative weight --> CIE color space introduced

HSV --> Hue, Saturation, Value

Primal sketch
The primal sketch is a symbolic, two-dimensional description of the significant grey-level changes in an image. Psychophysical evidence suggests a primal sketch in human vision, rather like that proposed by Marr, although different in many details


2.5D is an effect in visual perception. It is the construction of an apparently three-dimensional environment from 2D retinal projections. While the result is technically 2D, it allows for the illusion of depth
