Start with greedy

And then try to apply these techniques:-
	Constraint Programming
	Local Search
	Mixed Integer Programming

<-----------------THE KNAPSACK PROBLEM----------------->

Optimization Models
	choose decision variables
	express problem constraints in terms of decision variables
	express objective function

Pseudo-polynomial time complexity

BRANCH AND BOUND
	Explore only a part of the tree

	VALUE OF RELAXATION
		Linear relaxation:-	0 <= x <= 1
		--> gives an execellent upper bound

	SEARCH STRATEGIES
		Depth-first search --> prune when a node estimation is worse than the best found solution
		Best-first --> select node with best estimation
		Least-discrepancy --> Greedy heuristic
		Limited-discrepancy
		- many others
